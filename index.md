Nomad AI was founded during summer 2018 by former PhD students in Artificial Intelligence at Kyoto University. Nomad AI takes advantage of the recent advances in AI to develop iOS and Android applications with powerful offline capabilities such as optical text recognition, machine translation or music chord recognition. Nomad AI creations are available on the Apple Store and Google Play Stores:
* [Chord AI](https://apps.apple.com/app/chord-ai/id1446177109) <font color="#FF7F50"><b>NEW! (08-08-2019)</b></font> : Chord AI is an iOS app which can recognize 168 chords by analyzing music from either your microphone or from your offline audio files.

# Chord AI

The [Chord AI](https://www.chordai.net) project was born after Nomad AI founders met [Guillaume Bellec](https://guillaumebellec.github.io/) at the International Conference in Learning Representations in Vancouver, in April 2018. The project initial goal was to build the first iOS app for recognizing music chords in real-time using the device microphone. The [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/chord-ai/id1446177109) has been released in August 2019, and is able to successfully recognize major and minor chords with high accuracy. Since then, Chord AI developers is working on extending the number of recognized chords as well as various music information retrieval tasks. An Android version of Chord AI should be available in January 2019.
