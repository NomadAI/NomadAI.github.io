The [Chord AI](https://www.chordai.net) project was born after a chance meeting during the ICLR conference in Vancouver, in April 2018. Our goal was to build the first iOS app for recognizing music chords in real-time using the device microphone. The [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/chord-ai/id1446177109) has been released in August 2019, and was able to successfully recognize major and minor chords with high accuracy. Since then, Chord AI developers have extended extending tremendously the number of recognized chords. An [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chordai&hl=en) has been released in April 2020
